# Product Store Application

This project is a simple **Product Store Application** that fetches product data from an API and displays it on a webpage. The application consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to retrieve data from an external source. The tasks for this project were split into two main parts: fetching and displaying data, and handling errors in the fetch request.
